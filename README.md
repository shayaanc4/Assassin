Description

The Assassin Game is a console-based Java simulation that combines strategy, suspense, and dynamic gameplay. Each player is assigned a target in a circular chain, and the goal is to eliminate all other players while avoiding elimination yourself. The game features a leaderboard to track player kills and a target shuffling mechanic to keep the gameplay fresh and unpredictable.

This project showcases object-oriented programming principles such as encapsulation, modularity, and dynamic data structures.

Features
